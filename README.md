# wakanda

This starter full stack project has been generated using AlgoKit. See below for default getting started instructions.

## Setup

### Initial setup

1. Clone this repository locally.
2. Install pre-requisites:
   - Make sure to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running on your machine.
   - Install `AlgoKit` - [Link](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli#install): The minimum required version is `1.3.0`. Ensure you can execute `algokit --version` and get `1.3.0` or later.
   - Bootstrap your local environment; run `algokit bootstrap all` within this folder, which will install Poetry, run `npm install` and `poetry install` in the root directory to install NPM and Python packages respectively, set up a `.venv` folder with a Python virtual environment and also install all Python dependencies.
     - For TypeScript projects, it will also run `npm install` to install NPM packages.
     - For all projects, it will copy `.env.template` to `.env`.
   - Run `algokit localnet start` to start a local Algorand network in Docker. If you are using VS Code launch configurations provided by the template, this will be done automatically for you.
3. Open the project and start debugging / developing on:
   - [Backend](backend/README.md) - Refer to the README for more information on how to work with smart contracts.
   - [Frontend](frontend/README.md) - Refer to the README for more information on how to work with the frontend application.


### Subsequently

1. If you update to the latest source code and there are new dependencies, you will need to run `algokit bootstrap all` again.
2. Follow step 3 above.

### Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

This project uses [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) to define CI/CD workflows, which are located in the [`.github/workflows`](./.github/workflows) folder. You can configure these actions to suit your project's needs, including CI checks, audits, linting, type checking, testing, and deployments to TestNet.

For pushes to `main` branch, after the above checks pass, the following deployment actions are performed:
  - The smart contract(s) are deployed to TestNet using [AlgoNode](https://algonode.io).
  - The frontend application is deployed to a provider of your choice (Netlify, Vercel, etc.). See [frontend README](frontend/README.md) for more information.

> Please note deployment of smart contracts is done via `algokit deploy` command which can be invoked both via CI as seen on this project, or locally. For more information on how to use `algokit deploy` please see [AlgoKit documentation](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/features/deploy.md).

## Tools

This project makes use of Python and React to build Algorand smart contracts and to provide a base project configuration to develop frontends for your Algorand dApps and interactions with smart contracts. The following tools are in use:

- Algorand, AlgoKit, and AlgoKit Utils
- Python dependencies including Poetry, Black, Ruff or Flake8, mypy, pytest, and pip-audit
- React and related dependencies including AlgoKit Utils, Tailwind CSS, daisyUI, use-wallet, npm, jest, playwright, Prettier, ESLint, and Github Actions workflows for build validation

### VS Code

It has also been configured to have a productive dev experience out of the box in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), see the [backend .vscode](./backend/.vscode) and [frontend .vscode](./frontend/.vscode) folders for more details.

## Integrating with smart contracts and application clients

Refer to the [backend](backend/README.md) folder for overview of working with smart contracts, [frontend](frontend/README.md) for overview of the React project and the [frontend/contracts](frontend/src/contracts/README.md) folder for README on adding new smart contracts from backend as application clients on your frontend. The templates provided in these folders will help you get started.
When you compile and generate smart contract artifacts, your frontend component will automatically generate typescript application clients from smart contract artifacts and move them to `frontend/src/contracts` folder, see [`generate:app-clients` in package.json](frontend/package.json). Afterwards, you are free to import and use them in your frontend application.

The frontend starter also provides an example of interactions with your HelloWorldClient in [`AppCalls.tsx`](frontend/src/components/AppCalls.tsx) component by default.

## Next Steps

You can take this project and customize it to build your own decentralized applications on Algorand. Make sure to understand how to use AlgoKit and how to write smart contracts for Algorand before you start.

This starter React project has been generated using AlgoKit. See below for default getting started instructions.

# Setup

### Initial setup

1. Clone this repository locally
2. Install pre-requisites:
   - Make sure to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running on your machine.
   - Install `AlgoKit` - [Link](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli#install): The minimum required version is `1.1`. Ensure you can execute `algokit --version` and get `1.1` or later.
   - Bootstrap your local environment; run `algokit bootstrap all` within this folder, which will run `npm install` to install NPM packages and dependencies for your frontend component/webapp.
   - Run `algokit localnet start` to start a local Algorand network in Docker. If you are using VS Code launch configurations provided by the template, this will be done automatically for you.
3. Open the project and start debugging / developing via:
   - VS Code
     1. Open the repository root in VS Code
     2. Install recommended extensions
     3. Hit F5 (or whatever you have debug mapped to) and it should start running with breakpoint debugging.
   - JetBrains WebStorm
     1. Open the repository root in WebStorm
     2. Hit Shift+F10|Ctrl+R (or whatever you have debug mapped to). Then Shift+CMD|Ctrl+Click on the link in the console to open the browser with debugger attached.
   - Other
     1. Open the repository root in your text editor of choice
     2. In a terminal run `npm run dev`

### Subsequently

1. If you update to the latest source code and there are new dependencies you will need to run `algokit bootstrap all` again
2. Follow step 3 above

> Please note, by default frontend is pre configured to run against Algorand LocalNet. If you want to run against TestNet or MainNet, comment out the current environment variable and uncomment the relevant one in [`.env`](.env) file that is created after running bootstrap command and based on [`.env.template`](.env.template).

# Algorand Wallet integrations

The template comes with [`use-wallet`](https://github.com/txnlab/use-wallet) integration, which provides a React hook for connecting to an Algorand wallet providers. The following wallet providers are included by default:
- LocalNet:
- - [KMD/Local Wallet](https://github.com/TxnLab/use-wallet#kmd-algorand-key-management-daemon) - Algorand's Key Management Daemon (KMD) is a service that manages Algorand private keys and signs transactions. Works best with AlgoKit LocalNet and allows you to easily test and interact with your dApps locally.
- TestNet and others:
- - [Pera Wallet](https://perawallet.app).
- - [Defly Wallet](https://defly.app).
- - [Exodus Wallet](https://www.exodus.com).
- - [Daffi Wallet](https://www.daffi.me).

Refer to official [`use-wallet`](https://github.com/txnlab/use-wallet) documentation for detailed guidelines on how to integrate with other wallet providers (such as WalletConnect v2). Too see implementation details on the use wallet hook and initialization of extra wallet providers refer to [`App.tsx`](./src/App.tsx).

# Integrating with smart contracts and application clients

Refer to the detailed guidance on [integrating with smart contracts and application clients](./src/contracts/README.md). In essence, for any smart contract codebase generated with AlgoKit or other tools that produce compile contracts into ARC34 compliant app specifications, you can use the `algokit generate` command to generate TypeScript or Python typed client. Once generated simply drag and drop the generated client into `./src/contracts` and import it into your React components as you see fit.
